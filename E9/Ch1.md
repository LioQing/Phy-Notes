remarks:  
- anterior chamber contains aqueous humour
- optic disc = blind spot
- fovea = yellow spot
- ciliary body have ciliary muscles

process of sense of vision:  
1. light refracted by **cornea**
2. passes through **pupil**
3. refracted (**accommodated**) by **lens**
4. falls on **retina**
5. nerve impulses sent to the brain through **optic nerve**  

image produced in the eye:  
- inverted
- real
- diminished

medium | refractive index
--- | ---
air | 1.00
cornea | 1.38
aqueous humour | 1.34
lens | 1.40
vitreous humour | 1.34  
<br>

**light sensitive cells**  
</empty> | rod cells | cone cells
--- | --- | ---
sensitive to | intensities of light | colours of light
responsible in env. and sensitive in | dark env. | bright env.
distribution | none in yellow spot and blind spot | none in blind spot, concentrated in yellow spot  
types | only 1 type | 3 types: mainly responsible for red, green, blue respectively
<br>

**power of lens**  
def: reciprocal of the focal length  
unit: dioptre (D)  
symbol: P

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\P=\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{u}%2b\frac{1}{v})   

*f* = focal length (in metre)  
*u* = object distance  
*v* = image distance  

convex: +ve power  
concave: -ve power  

when lenses are thin and close together  
the power combination is the sum of their powers

**accommodation**  
def: changing shape of lens to focus on an object (i.e. produces a sharp image)  

</empty> | near point | far point
--- | --- | ---
definition | closest position which a normal human eye can focus | farthest position which a normal human eye can focus 
value | 25 cm | infinity  
<br>

**resolving power**  
def (of our eyes): how much detail we can see and distinguish  
when 2 points of light enters our eye with a small incident angle, it may appear as 1 point

**minimum angular separation**  
def: the smallest angular separation for an eye to distinguish  
unit: radians (rad)  
symbol: θ<sub>min<sub>  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\theta_{min}=\frac{1.22\lambda}{D})   

*λ*: the wavelength of the light  
*D*: diameter of pupil  

**spectral response**

**defects of vision and correction**  

</empty> | short sight | long sight | old sight  
--- | --- | --- | ---
causes | eye too powerful; eyeball too long | eye too weak; eyeball to short | lens lose elasticity (as person get older)
effect | far point decreased | near point increased | far point and near point changed (cannot accommodate) 
correction lens | concave (-ve power) | convex (+ve power) | bifocal lens (have both convex and concave lenses)

## 1.2 Hearing

remarks:  
- pinna = ear flap
- ossicles = ear bones  

keywords:  
- outer ear
	- structures
		- ear flap
	- function
		- collects sounds from the surroundings
		- directs sound waves towards the middle ear
- middle ear
	- strctures
		- ear bones
	- function
		- convert sound waves into mechanical vibrations
		- amplify the vibration
		- transmits the vibration towards the inner ear
- inner ear
	- structures
		- cochlea
		- auditory nerve
	- function
		- convert vibrations into electrical signals
		- send the signals along auditory nerve to the brain

mechanism of amplification
1. eardrum struck by sound waves and vibrates
2. ear bones amplify the vibration
3. vibration passed to the oval window

2 factors:  
- 3 ear bones act as lever (about the middle piece as pivot) to amplify *force by 1.3x*
- *area* of eardrum is *17x* that of oval window

pressure = F/A = (F<sub>0</sub> x 1.3) / (A<sub>0</sub> x 17) ≈ *22x* (pressure on eardrum)  

conversion to electrical signals  
- cochlea
	- a coiled tube
	- consists of 3 chemicals filled with fluid
	- vibration through oval window to upper channel
	- vibration leaves at round window from lower channel
	- basilar membrane
		- between upper and lower channel
		- detect vibration
		- can resonate
	- features
		- detect 20 Hz to 20 kHz
		- connects to auditory nerves and send electrical signals

**intensity (sound)**  
def: the amount of energy passes through a unit area per unit time  
unit: W m<sup>-2</sup>  

follows inverse square law  

**sound intensity level**  
def: a logarithmic scale of sound intensity  
unit: decibel (dB)  
symbol: L  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\L=10log_{10}\frac{I_{A}}{I_{0}})  

when I<sub>A</sub> changes (e.g. I<sub>A</sub> * 3):  
L<sub>new</sub>  
= 10 * log( 3I<sub>A</sub> / I<sub>0</sub> )  
= 10 * log3 + 10 log( I<sub>A</sub> / I<sub>0</sub> )  
*= 10 * log3 + L<sub>old</sub>*  
= L<sub>old</sub> + 4.8  

comparing 2 sound intensity/sound intensity level:  
L<sub>1</sub> = 10log( I<sub>1</sub> / I<sub>0</sub> ) ... 1  
L<sub>2</sub> = 10log( I<sub>2</sub> / I<sub>0</sub> ) ... 2  

2 - 1:  
*ΔL = 10log( I<sub>2</sub> / I<sub>1</sub> )*

**loudness**  
depends on the listener  
unit: phon  

curves of equal loudness  
<img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hani_Camille_Yehia/publication/228682953/figure/fig2/AS:302083103313923@1449033632276/Equal-loudness-curves-after-DW-Robinson-and-RS-Dadson-1956.png">  

image from: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Equal-loudness-curves-after-DW-Robinson-and-RS-Dadson-1956_fig2_228682953  

phon scale is taken pure notes of 1000 Hz for reference  
i.e. at 1000 Hz, value of dB = phon  

for certain type of people with hearing problem:  
</empty> | age-related hearing loss | noise-related hearing loss
--- | --- | ---
overall curve (at all frequencies) | shift upward to higher sound intensity level | shift upward to higher sound intensity level  
at low frequencies | smaller shift upward | smaller shift upward
at around 2 - 5 kHz | - | a crest of shifting upward for a lot
at high frequencies | larger shift upward | -
