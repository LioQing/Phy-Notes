remarks:  
- anterior chamber contains aqueous humour
- optic disc = blind spot
- fovea = yellow spot
- ciliary body have ciliary muscles

process of sense of vision:  
1. light refracted by **cornea**
2. passes through **pupil**
3. refracted (**accommodated**) by **lens**
4. falls on **retina**
5. nerve impulses sent to the brain through **optic nerve**  

medium | refractive index
--- | ---
air | 1.00
cornea | 1.38
aqueous humour | 1.34
lens | 1.40
vitreous humour | 1.34

**light sensitive cells**  
</empty> | rod cells | cone cells
--- | --- | ---
sensitive to | intensities of light | colours of light
responsible in env. | dark env. | bright env.
distribution | none in yellow spot and blind spot | none in blind spot, concentrated in yellow spot  
<br>

**power of lens**  
def: reciprocal of the focal length  
unit: dioptre (D)  
symbol: P

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\P=\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{u}%2b\frac{1}{v})   

*f* = focal length (in metre)  
*u* = object distance  
*v* = image distance  

convex: +ve power  
concave: -ve power  

when lenses are thin and close together  
the power combination is the sum of their powers

**accommodation**  
def: changing shape of lens to focus on an object (i.e. produces a sharp image)  

</empty> | near point | far point
--- | --- | ---
definition | closest position which a normal human eye can focus | farthest position which a normal human eye can focus 
value | 25 cm | infinity  
<br>

**resolving power**  
def (of our eyes): how much detail we can see and distinguish  
when 2 points of light enters our eye with a small incident angle, it may appear as 1 point

**minimum angular separation**  
def: the smallest angular separation for an eye to distinguish  
unit: radians (rad)  
symbol: θ<sub>min<sub>  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\theta_{min}=\frac{1.22\lambda}{D})   

*λ*: the wavelength of the light  
*D*: diameter of pupil  

**spectral response**  

receptor absorption curve

**defects of vision and correction**  

</empty> | short sight | long sight | old sight  
--- | --- | --- | ---
causes | eye too powerful; eyeball too long | eye too weak; eyeball to short | lens lose elasticity (as person get older)
effect | far point decreased | near point increased | far point and near point changed (cannot accommodate) 
correction lens | concave (-ve power) | convex (+ve power) | bifocal lens (have both convex and concave lenses)
