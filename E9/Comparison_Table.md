## Comparison Tables of Different Imaging Methods

</empty> | ultrasound | X-ray | 
--- | --- | --- 
ionizing | no | yes 
invasive | no | no
tissue good contrast | soft tissues | bony structures (or apply with artificial contrast medium for soft tissues)
tissue poor contrast | tissues covered/filled with bones/gases | soft tissues
possible overlapping structures | no | yes
precaution | bubble may form, absorbed wave converted to heat | some patient may be allergic to the artificial contrast medium

</empty> | X-ray | CT scan
--- | --- | ---
ionizing | yes | yes (longer time => higher exposure to radiation)
invasive | no | no
cost | less expensive | more expensive
time | very fast | longer timer (2~3 mins) 
imaging method | single image | multiple projections
detail | less detailed | more detailed
tissue good contrast | bony structures | all kinds of structures
tissue poor contrast | soft tissues | -

</empty> | X-ray | RNI
--- | --- | ---
EM wave used | X-rays | γ rays
ionizing | yes | yes (longer time => higher exposure to radiation)
invasive | no | no
cost | less expensive | more expensive
time | very fast | longer time (0.5~2 mins for imaging)
principle | detect X-rays attenuated through body | detect γ rays emitted from body by radioactive tracers
usage | scanning structures | monitor functions of organs
resolution | good | poor
