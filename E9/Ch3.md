## Ch.3 Ionizing Medical Imaging

## 3.1 X-rays and Radiographic Imaging

**Ionizing Radiation**  
\- has very high energy  
\- can ionize atom or molecule  
\- can damage or kill living tissues  
\- higher frequencies => higher energy  
\- small size or wavelength  
\- can penetrate deep into material  
\- from UV to gamma ray  

**X-rays**  
nature:  
\- EM waves
\- high frequencies  
\- can blacken photographic film through chemical reaction  
\- frequency range: 10<sup>16</sup> to 10<sup>19</sup> Hz  
\- energy range: 100 eV to 100 keV  

production:  
1\. very high-speed electrons with high energy hit a heavy metal target  
2\. during the hit, electrons decelerate rapidly, some KE lost  
3\. electrons in heavy metal become excited  
4\. when excited electrons' energy level drops, X-ray is emitted  

**attenuation**  
causes:  
\- electrons ionizes the medium  
\- electrons scattered when they travel  

factors:  
\- density of medium => high => high attenuation  
\- atomic number of element that makes up the medium => large => high attenuation  
\- x-ray frequency => lower => higher attenutation  

**linear attenutation coeeficient**  
def: the distance x-ray travelled in a uniform medium to decrease the intensity  
unit: cm<sup>-1</sup>  
symbol: μ

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\I=I_{0}\cdot\\\e^{\mu\\\x})  

*I*: resultant intensity  
*I<sub>0</sub>*: initial intensity  
*x*: distance travelled  

**half-value thickness (HVT)**  
def: the distance travelled by the x-ray to decrease intensity by half  
unit: cm  
symbol: x<sub>½</sub>  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\x_{{}^1/_{2}}=\frac{\ln2}{\mu})  

**X-ray radiographic imaging**  
working principle:  
1\. X-ray beam is emitted from an X-ray tube  
2\. X-rays passes through our body  
3\. due to tissues having different compositions and thicknesses  
4\. X-rays are attenuated to different degree  
5\. X-rays blacken photographic film  

\- X-rays attenuated more by human body => less x-ray hit the film => white  
\- X-rays attenuated less by human body => more x-ray hit the film => darker  

advantages:  
\- relatively inexpensive to CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging  
\- simple & fast  
\- provide good resolution of bony structure  

disadvantages:  
\- ionizing  
\- poor contrast of soft tissue  
\- image of body structures may overlap  
\- usage of artificial contrast medium may be unpleasant or trigger allergic reactions

**artificial contrast medium**  
\- high linear attenuation coefficient  
\- to distinguish soft tissues  

example - to produce sharp contrast between stomach and its nearby tissues:  
1\. patient need to orally take in artificial contrast medium  
2\. medium coats the inner surface of stomach and the organ become opaque to X-rays  
3\. clear image of X-ray is produced
