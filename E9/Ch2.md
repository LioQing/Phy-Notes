## Ch.2 Non-ionizing Medical Imaging

## 2.1 Medical Imaging
def: the process of creating a visual representation of the inside of our body for medical use

**invasive & non-invasive**  
def of invasive: instruments have to be introduced into a patient's body

examples:  
- radioactive tracer for thyroid scan
- endoscope in endoscopy

## 2.2 Ultrasound Scans
def: sound wave with frequency > 20 kHz  
(> upper limit of human audible frequency)  

nature: 
- longitudinal
- travelling
- mechanical

properties:  
- reflection
- refraction
- diffraction
- interference

**echolocation**  
def: emitting ultrasound wave and analyse the choes to locate an object

**ultrasound imaging**  
frequency range: 1 - 20 MHz
- 3 - 5 MHz for deeper structures
    - kidney
    - liver
- 7 - 12 MHz for near surface organs  
    - thyroid
    - breast

**piezoelectric effect**  
def: the ability of a material to generate electric charge by compression & stress, and vice versa

production of ultrasound wave:  
1. ac voltage of > 20 kHz is appied across a crystal
2. the crystal will be compressed & stressed
3. ultrasound wave is emitted

detection of ultrasound wave:
1. ultrasound wave hits the crystal
2. the crystal is stretched & compressed by the wave
3. ac voltage is generated

**transducer**

image from: https://radiopaedia.org/articles/ultrasound-transducer  

main components:  
- piezoelectric crystal/element
    - emits ultrasound waves
    - detect reflected ultrasound echoes
- damping block/**backing material**
    - damp & absorb the ultrasound wave emitted backward
    - damp the ultrasound wave & the oscillation of the crystal when entering waiting time
- electrodes
    - transmit electrical signals to and from the crystal
- matching layer
    - increase sensation of returning echoes
    - increase transfer efficiecny of ultrasound wave from the crystal to the patient

**pulse emission**

t<sub>p</sub> = emits pulse duration = 10 μs  
Δt = waiting time = 1 ms = 1000 μs  

waiting time is for detection of ultrasound echoes
