## 3.1 Energy Efficiency in Buildings  

**building envelope**  
def: outermost *components which heat enter or leave* a building (*not* including *floor*)  

**ways of heat transfer**  
- conduction
	- roof
	- wall
	- window
- radiation
	- window

**thermal conductivity**  
def: how well a material conducts heat  
unit: W m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>  
symbol: κ  

**thermal transmittance** (**U-value**)  
def: the thermal conductivity per unit length of the thickness of a layer  
unit: W m<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\U=\frac{\kappa}{d})  

*d*: thickness of the layer  

**law of conduction**  
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\P=\frac{Q}{t}=\kappa\frac{A\Delta\\\T}{d}=UA\Delta\\\T)  

*P*: rate of heat conduction  
*Q*: heat (energy) transferred  
*t*: length of time  
*A*: area of the layer  
*ΔT*: temperature difference between 2 sides (T<sub>hot</sub> - T<sub>cold</sub>)  

**Overall Thermal Transfer Value** (**OTTV**)  
def: rate of heat gain per unit area *through the building envelope* (averaged over 1 year)  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\OTTV=\frac{\Sigma\\\P}{\Sigma\\\A})  

*ΣP*: total heat transfer through the envelope  
*ΣA*: total area of the envelope  

**reduce heat transfer**  
- walls and roofs
	- *heat-insulating materials*
		- *air spaces ˄* & *thermal conductivities ˅* => *conduction* ˅
- windows
	- *double-glazed* windows
		- gas (e.g. *argon*) in between with thermal conductivity ˅ => *conduction* ˅
		- gas in between 2 glass panes => thickness *d* ˄ => *conduction* ˅
	- low-emissivity (*low-e*) coatings
		- coating *reflect most IR* but let visible light in => *radiation* ˅  
	- solar film
		- similar to low-e coating
- shades
	- control shades => control radiation
- design
	- direction of facing
