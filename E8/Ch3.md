## 3.1 Energy Efficiency in Buildings  

**building envelope**  
def: outermost *components which heat enter or leave* a building (*not* including *floor*)  

**ways of heat transfer**  
- conduction
	- roof
	- wall
	- window
- radiation
	- window

**thermal conductivity**  
def: how well a material conducts heat  
unit: W m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>  
symbol: κ  

**thermal transmittance** (**U-value**)  
def: the thermal conductivity per unit length of the thickness of a layer  
unit: W m<sup>-2</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\U=\frac{\kappa}{d})  

*d*: thickness of the layer  

**law of conduction**  
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\P=\frac{Q}{t}=\kappa\frac{A\Delta\\\T}{d}=UA\Delta\\\T)  

*P*: rate of heat conduction  
*Q*: heat (energy) transferred  
*t*: length of time  
*A*: area of the layer  
*ΔT*: temperature difference between 2 sides (T<sub>hot</sub> - T<sub>cold</sub>)  

**U-value of multiple layers of materials**  
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\U=\Sigma\frac{1}{U})  

**Overall Thermal Transfer Value** (**OTTV**)  
def: rate of heat gain per unit area *through the building envelope* (averaged over 1 year)  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\OTTV=\frac{\Sigma\\\P}{\Sigma\\\A})  

*ΣP*: total heat transfer through the envelope  
*ΣA*: total area of the envelope  

**reduce heat transfer**  
- walls and roofs
	- *heat-insulating materials*
		- *air spaces ˄* & *thermal conductivities ˅* => *conduction* ˅
- windows
	- *double-glazed* windows
		- gas (e.g. *argon*) in between with thermal conductivity ˅ => *conduction* ˅
		- gas in between 2 glass panes => thickness *d* ˄ => *conduction* ˅
	- low-emissivity (*low-e*) coatings
		- coating *reflect most IR* but let visible light in => *radiation* ˅  
	- solar film
		- similar to low-e coating
- shades
	- control shades => control radiation
- design
	- orientation

## 3.2 Energy Efficiency in Transportation

**traditional vehicles**  
powered by *internal combustion engines* (*ICE*)  
which burn *fossil fuels* (petrol, diesel, LPG)  
  
energy conversion:  
chemical energy (fuel) (*100%*) -> ICE (*80% lost*) -> mechanical energy (*20%*)

**electric vehicles**  
powered by *electric motors*  
which are driven by *batteries*  
  
energy conversion:  
chemical energy (battery) (*100%*) -> lithium ion battery (*1% lost*) -> electrical energy (*99%*) -> motor (*9% lost*) -> mechanical energy (*90%*)  
  
*regenerative breaking system*:  
1\. car brakes  
2\. motor act as a generator to convert *part of KE* into electrical energy

**hybrid electric vehicles (HEV)**  
combines traditional and electric vehicles  

3 conditions:  
1\. high power needed (going uphill, speeding up)  
=> fossil fuel to ICE & battery to motor  
2\. low power needed   
=> only fossil fuel to ICE  
3\. power more than needed (going downhill, braking)  
=> regenerative braking (motor as generator to battery)

**comparison**
</empty> | traditional vehicle | electric vehicle | HEV
--- | --- | --- | ---
type of energy storage | fossil fuel | battery | fossile fuel and battery
mass of energy storage | light | heavy | light
energy converter | internal combustion engine | motor | internal combustion engine & motor
energy refill | short | long | short
mileage | long | short | medium
regenerative braking system | no | yes | yes
main advantage | large mileage | no emission at where it is being used | energy efficient
main disadvatage | pollute air where it travels, fossil fuels are not environmentally friendly | long charging time, short mileage, more expensive | more expensive, more complex designs

**mass transportation**  
carry more people and use relatively less energy  
=> more *energy efficient*
