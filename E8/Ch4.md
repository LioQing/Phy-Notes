## Different Sources of Energy

## 4.1 Electricity and Energy

types of energy sources:  
\- renewable energy sources - can be regenerated in a short time  
\- non-renewable energy sources - can be depleted and cannot be regenerated in a short time  

## 4.2 Energy Sources  

**fossil fuel**  
formation take a very long time - non-renewable  

examples:  
\- coal  
\- petroleum  
\- natrual gas  

**nuclear power**  
non-renewable  

**binding energy**  
nucleons (protons and neutrons) are bound by strong short-range attractive forces (including gravitational force)  

def: the required work done to pull the nucleus apart  
unit: electronvolts (eV)  
symbol: E<sub>b</sub>  

average binding energy per nucleon (E<sub>b</sub>/A)  
suggest how stable the nucleus is

an *iron* nucleus is the *most stable* from the graph  
*light* nuclei undergo *fusion* to form heavy nuclei  
*heavy* nuclei undergo *fission* to form light nuclei  

**mass defect**  
def: the missing mass releases energy in a fusion or fission  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\Delta\\\E=\Delta\\\mc^2)  

*ΔE*: energy released  
*Δm*: mass defect  
*c*: speed of light in a vacuum  

**uranium as fuel**  
chain reaction:  
1\. U235 captures a *slow-moving* neutron  
2\. splits into 2 daughter neclei  
3\. 2 or 3 neutrons are given out  
4\. the neutrons *trigger other U235 nuclides* to undergo fission  

fission equation:  
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\^{235}\U\%2b\n(\slow)\rightarrow^{236}\U\rightarrow\X\%2b\Y\%2b\2\or\3\n(\fast)\%2b\energy)  

**fission reactor**  
aka. pressurized water reactor

structure:  
\- *fuel rods* - contains uranium fuel for fission  
\- *control rods* - absorb excessive neutrons to control power output  
\- *pressurized water* - carry heat from fuel rods to boiler, acts as *moderator* to slow down fast neutrons  

1\. the steam produced in boiler drive the turbine which powers a generator  
2\. seawater as coolant, steam is condensed back into water  
3\. water returns boiler, warmed seawater release energy to air or sea  

safety  
- nuclear reactions are under control
	- shut down by *inserting control rods completely*  
	- injecting a *boric acid solution*
- no radiation leaks
	- physical condition in the reactors are monitored by multiple devices
	- reinforced building is used to isolate reactor from the environment
- nuclear waste is properly handled
	- spent fuel rods are stored in the power plant to be moved away when power is low enough
	- *nuclear waste* is permanently sealed and buried deep underground

Pros:  
\- do not produce CO2 or smoke particles  
\- lot of energy is produced from a small amount of fuel  

Cons:  
\- waste is radioactive and has long half life  
\- ending the service of nuclear power is expensive  
\- danger when accidents happen, radiation can spread over wide area and have great impact
