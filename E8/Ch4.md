## Different Sources of Energy

## 4.1 Electricity and Energy

types of energy sources:  
\- renewable energy sources - can be regenerated in a short time  
\- non-renewable energy sources - can be depleted and cannot be regenerated in a short time  

## 4.2 Energy Sources  

**fossil fuel**  
formation take a very long time - non-renewable  

examples:  
\- coal  
\- petroleum  
\- natrual gas  

**nuclear power**  
non-renewable  

**binding energy**  
nucleons (protons and neutrons) are bound by strong short-range attractive forces (including gravitational force)  

def: the required work done to pull the nucleus apart  
unit: electronvolts (eV)  
symbol: E<sub>b</sub>  

average binding energy per nucleon (E<sub>b</sub>/A)  
suggest how stable the nucleus is

an *iron* nucleus is the *most stable* from the graph  
*light* nuclei undergo *fusion* to form heavy nuclei  
*heavy* nuclei undergo *fission* to form light nuclei  

**mass defect**  
def: the missing mass releases energy in a fusion or fission  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\Delta\\\E=\Delta\\\mc^2)  

*ΔE*: energy released  
*Δm*: mass defect  
*c*: speed of light in a vacuum  

**uranium as fuel**  
chain reaction:  
1\. U235 captures a *slow-moving* neutron  
2\. splits into 2 daughter neclei  
3\. 2 or 3 neutrons are given out  
4\. the neutrons *trigger other U235 nuclides* to undergo fission  

fission equation:  
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\^{235}\U\%2b\n(\slow)\rightarrow^{236}\U\rightarrow\X\%2b\Y\%2b\2\or\3\n(\fast)\%2b\energy)  

**fission reactor**  
aka. pressurized water reactor

structure:  
\- *fuel rods* - contains uranium fuel for fission  
\- *control rods* - absorb excessive neutrons to control power output  
\- *pressurized water* - carry heat from fuel rods to boiler, acts as *moderator* to slow down fast neutrons  

1\. the steam produced in boiler drive the turbine which powers a generator  
2\. seawater as coolant, steam is condensed back into water  
3\. water returns boiler, warmed seawater release energy to air or sea  

safety  
- nuclear reactions are under control
	- shut down by *inserting control rods completely*  
	- injecting a *boric acid solution*
- no radiation leaks
	- physical condition in the reactors are monitored by multiple devices
	- reinforced building is used to isolate reactor from the environment
- nuclear waste is properly handled
	- spent fuel rods are stored in the power plant to be moved away when power is low enough
	- *nuclear waste* is permanently sealed and buried deep underground

Pros:  
\- do not produce CO2 or smoke particles  
\- lot of energy is produced from a small amount of fuel  

Cons:  
\- waste is radioactive and has long half life  
\- building the reactor is expensive
\- ending the service of nuclear power is expensive  
\- danger when accidents happen, radiation can spread over wide area and have great impact  

**wind power**  
renewable energy  
KE of wind -> KE of turbine -> electrical energy

power calculation  
![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\P_{max}=\frac{E}{t}=\frac{\frac{1}{2}mv^2}{t}=\frac{1}{2}(\rho\\\Av)v^2=\frac{1}{2}\rho\\\Av^3)  

*P<sub>max</sub>*: maximum power generated, i.e. KE of wind  
*ρ*: density of air  
*A*: area the turbine covers when spinning  
*v*: velocity of wind  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\P=\eta\\\P_{max}=\frac{1}{2}\eta\\\Av^3)  

*η*: efficiency  

structure of turbines:  
\- *number*  
=> too much => wind can't pass  
=> too few => force ˄ => endurance ˅  
\- *length*  
=> too long => generate ˄ => mass ˄  
=> too short => generate ˅ => mass ˅  

Pros:  
\- do not produce any harmful by-products  
\- one of the cheapest energy technologies  

Cons:  
\- large amount of space is needed to build a wind farm  
\- depends on weather and location  
\- may pose threat to birds and bats  
\- noise pollution  

**hydroelectric power**  
renewable energy  
PE of water -> KE of water -> KE of turbine -> electrical energy  

a *dam* is usually built together to control the water flow  
water in the *upper reservoir* on one side of the dam flow through  

Pros:  
\- do not produce any harmful by-products  
\- operating cost is low  
\- generally reliable and only small fluctation in power output  

Cons:  
\- alter natural water flow => disrupt aquatic habitat  
\- large area has to be flooded when building the dam and the upper reservoir => wildlife habitats, forests and agricultural lands nearby would be flooded  
\- building the station and the dam is expensive (cheaper than nuclear reactor)  

**solar power**  
renewable energy  

*solar constant*  
def: solar radiation per unit area received on top of the atmosphere of Earth  
usual value: 1360 W m<sup>-2</sup>  

*solar heating*  
a solar collector and a water storage tank  
1\. cold water flows into the tubes and is heated by the sun  
2\. hot water rises and flows out of the tube dur to natural convection  

features:  
\- blackened surface  
\- enveloped in a transparent flask  
\- simple  
\- inexpensive  
\- efficient (>60%)  

*solar electricity*  
a photovoltaic cell or a solar cell  
(LED in reverse way)

process:  
1\. when light is incident on the junction  
2\. an *electron is excited*, a *hole is formed*  
3\. the *electron moves to the n-side* due to E-field  
4\. *holes move towards the p-side*  
5\. if cell is connected to an external circuit, electrons *flow through from the n-side and recombine with the hole at the p-side*  

Pros:  
\- do not produce any harmful by-products  
\- sunlight is abundant
\- silent during operation  
\- low cost and frequency of maintenance

Cons:  
\- depends on the weather  
\- large area is needed for the panels or mirrors  
\- manufacturing solar cells may cause pollution  
\- solar cells are expensive and low efficiency  
\- dc current produced need to be converted to ac
