## Ch.2 Cooking and Air-conditioning  

## 2.1 Cooking without fire  

**electric hotplate and oven**  
make use of *heating elements*  

in hotplate: *cooking utensil* is placed on top of it and through *conduction*  
in oven: heating elemnts at the bottom transfer heat through *convection* and *radiation*  

**induction cooker**  
make use of *electromagnetic induction* to heat up a metal utensil  

process:  
1\. high frequency *ac current* passes through the *solenoid*  
2\. a *rapidly changing B-field* is produced  
3\. *eddy currents* are induced in the utensil above  
4\. the utensil is heated up and cooks the food  

**microwave oven**  
make use of *microwaves* to cook foods with *rich water content*  

reason the food is evenly heated:  
\- microwaves can partially penetrate into the food  
\- the food is rotated inside the oven  

process:  

necessary info:  
the water molecule consists of *2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom*  
=> electrons are drawn away from the hydrogen by the oxygen  
=> water molecule is *electrically polar*  

1\. microwaves passes through the food  
2\. polar water molecules *experience forces in the E-field*    
3\. the *field oscillate rapidly* => water molecules *flip up and down* violently  

**comparison**

</empty> | traditional cooker | electric hotplate | induction cooker | microwave oven
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
working principle | fire | heating effect of current | EM induction & heating effect of eddy current | polar water molecules flipped up and down by microwave
energy efficiency | low (gas stoves: ~40%) | medium (~70%) | high (~80%) | medium (~60%)
main advantage | quick to change temperature | cheap | high energy efficiecny | cook food evenly throughout
main disadvantage | gas leak is dangerous | cooking surface is very hot during operation | cooking utensils must be electrically conducting | for food of rich water content only
