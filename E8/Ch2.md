## Ch.2 Cooking and Air-conditioning  

## 2.1 Cooking without fire  

**electric hotplate and oven**  
make use of *heating elements*  

in hotplate: *cooking utensil* is placed on top of it and through *conduction*  
in oven: heating elemnts at the bottom transfer heat through *convection* and *radiation*  

**induction cooker**  
make use of *electromagnetic induction* to heat up a metal utensil  

process:  
1\. high frequency *ac current* passes through the *solenoid*  
2\. a *rapidly changing B-field* is produced  
3\. *eddy currents* are induced in the utensil above  
4\. the utensil is heated up and cooks the food  

**microwave oven**  
make use of *microwaves* to cook foods with *rich water content*  

reason the food is evenly heated:  
\- microwaves can partially penetrate into the food  
\- the food is rotated inside the oven  

process:  

necessary info:  
the water molecule consists of *2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom*  
=> electrons are drawn away from the hydrogen by the oxygen  
=> water molecule is *electrically polar*  

1\. microwaves passes through the food  
2\. polar water molecules *experience forces in the E-field*    
3\. the *field oscillate rapidly* => water molecules *flip up and down* violently  

**comparison**

</empty> | traditional cooker | electric hotplate | induction cooker | microwave oven
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
working principle | fire | heating effect of current | EM induction & heating effect of eddy current | polar water molecules flipped up and down by microwave
energy efficiency | low (gas stoves: ~40%) | medium (~70%) | high (~80%) | medium (~60%)
main advantage | quick to change temperature | cheap | high energy efficiecny | cook food evenly throughout
main disadvantage | gas leak is dangerous | cooking surface is very hot during operation | cooking utensils must be electrically conducting | for food of rich water content only

## 2.2 Air conditioning  

**air conditioners**  
are used to move heat from one place to another  

**cooling capacity**  
def: the *heat removed per unit time*  
unit: watt (W) or kilowatt (kW)  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\cooling%20\capacity=\frac{Q_{c}}{t})  
*Q<sub>c<sub>*: amount of heat removed  
*t*: length of time  

**coefficient of performance (COP)**  
def: the *ratio* of amount of *heat removed* to the amount of *work done* for the removal  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\COP=\frac{Q_{c}}{W}=\frac{\cooling%20\capacity}{P_{in}})  
*W*: work done  
*P<sub>in<sub>*: electrical power input  

**refrigeration cycle**  
is the process of the removal of heat  

components:  
\- **refrigerant**   
=> absorb latent heat from the indoor  
=> release latent heat to the outdoor  
\- **the evaporator**  
=> consists of coiled tubes  
\- **the compressor**  
=> compresses the vaporised refrigerant  
\- **the condenser**  
=> consist of coiled tubes  
\- **the expansion valve** (aka throttling device)  
=> expands the liquid refrigerant  
\- fan  
=> control the heat flow in air

process:  
1\. evaporation: *refrigerant* flows through the *evaporator*  
=> *absorb latent heat* of vaporisation from indoor and evaporates  
2\. compression: *compressor* compresses the *vaporised refrigerant*  
=> *high temperature and pressure*  
3\. condensation: *refrigerant* *releases latent heat* to outdoor in the condensor  
=> change back to a *liquid*  
4\. expansion/throttling: *expansion valve* expands the liquid refrigerant  
=> *low temperature and pressure*

**type of air conditioner**  
- window type air conditioner  
	- all the components are in one unit  
- split type air conditioner  
	- indoor unit consists the evaporator  
	- the outdoor unit consists the compressor, condenser, expansion valve  
- central air conditioning system  
	- usually use water as the coolant (chilled water central air conditioning system)  
	- air handling unit (AHU) for aborption of latent heat by the coolant  
	- chiller cool down warmed coolant  
	- dihumidification in AHU dry up the cooled air  

**energy labels for air conditioners**  
in HK, all air conditioners must have energy labels
