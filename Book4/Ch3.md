## Ch.3 Domestic Electricity

## 3.1 Electricity Power and Energy

**electrical power**  
def: the rate of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy  
unit: watts (W)  
symbol: P  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\P=\frac{E}{t}=IV=I^2R=\frac{V^2}{R})  

*E*: energy  
*t*: time  
*I*: current  
*R*: resistance  
*V*: voltage  

**calculating power dissipated**  
- in series
	- in each resistor
		- P = I<sup>2</sup>R
	- in the whole circuit
		- P<sub>total</sub> = I<sup>2</sup>R<sub>eq</sub>
- in parallel
	- in each resistor
		- P = V<sup>2</sup>/R
	- in the whole circuit
		- P<sub>total</sub> = V<sup>2</sup>/R<sub>eq</sub>

**power rating**  
def: label of rated values of voltage and power dissipated  
e.g.: 220 V, 1100 W  

domestic electrical appliances | typical power rating
--- | ---
heater | 2000 W
air conditioner | 1500 W
vacuum cleaner | 1400 W
washing machine | 950 W / program
microwave oven | 800 - 1200 W
TV | 70 - 180 W
refrigerator | 50 W
compact flurescent lamp | 11 - 22 W

**electrical energy**  
unit: kilowatt-hour (kW h) (this unit is more commonly used than joule (J))  
symbol: E   

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\E=Pt)  

**kilowatt-hour**  
def: 1 kW h is the energy transferred in 1 hour in an appiance whose power is 1 kilowatt  

1 kW h  
= 100 * 60 * 60  
= 3.6 * 10^6 J  
= 3.6 MJ  

## 3.2 Mains Electricity and Household Wiring

**alternating current (a.c.)**  
def: the current that reverse its direction of flow periodically  
220 V a.c. 50 Hz in mains electricity supply in HK

**live wire**  
colour: brown  
voltage: from positive peak +V to negative peak -V  

**neutral wire**  
colour: blue  
voltage: stays at 0 V  

**fuse**  
def: a short thin wire fitted inside a small cartridge  
location: in the live wire in plug or appliance  
function:  
1\. melt when overheated by a large current  
2\. break the circuit, forming an open circuit  
3\. prevent cable from overheating and causing fire when current overload  
remark: fuse value is generally slightly larger than operating current  

**earth wire**  
colour: yellow & green  
connected: to the metal case of the appliance  
function:  
1\. loose live wire touches metal body  
2\. large current flow to the earth thourgh earth wire and blow fuse in live wire  
3\. prevent the metal body from becoming live and may cause electric shock  

**double insulation**  
def: with an insulating plastic case  
2 layers of insulating materials: wire coverings & plastic case  
remark: appliances with double insulation do not need earth wire  

**three-pin plug and socket**  
def: 3 pins labelled L (live), N (neutral), E (earth)  
earth pin is slightly longer:  
1\. earth pin opens the shutters of live and neutral holes  
2\. earth wire is connected before live wire
3\. prevent accidental insertion of conductive objects  

**household wiring**

**circuit breaker**  
def: a switch that cuts off current flow when exceeding a value  
remark: similar to fuse but can be reset  

**parallel branches**  
def: the parallel circuits after branching from consumer unit  
advantage:  
- faults in 1 branch circuit will no affect other branch circuits  
- 1 big main circuit require thick wires to carry large current 
	- expensive  
- 1 electrical appliance running on low current becomes faulty 
	- the circuit breaker do not break  

**ring main**  
advantage:  
- current flows thought 2 separate live & neutral wires
	- lower current on each pair of wire
	- thinner & cheaper wires  
- all sockets work indepently 
	- fault in 1 socket will not affect others & every
	- each sockets can work at their rated value  

**lighting circuit**  
two-way switches: for turning on & off lights at 2 different locations
