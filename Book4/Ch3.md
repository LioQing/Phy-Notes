## Ch.3 Domestic Electricity

## 3.1 Electricity Power and Energy

**electrical power**  
def: the rate of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy  
unit: watts (W)  
symbol: P  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\P=\frac{E}{t}=IV=I^2R=\frac{V^2}{R})  

*E*: energy  
*t*: time  
*I*: current  
*R*: resistance  
*V*: voltage  

**calculating power dissipated**  
- in series
	- in each resistor
		- P = I<sup>2</sup>R
	- in the whole circuit
		- P<sub>total</sub> = I<sup>2</sup>R<sub>eq</sub>
- in parallel
	- in each resistor
		- P = V<sup>2</sup>/R
	- in the whole circuit
		- P<sub>total</sub> = V<sup>2</sup>/R<sub>eq</sub>

**power rating**  
def: label of rated values of voltage and power dissipated  
e.g.: 220 V, 1100 W  

domestic electrical appliances | typical power rating
--- | ---
heater | 2000 W
air conditioner | 1500 W
vacuum cleaner | 1400 W
washing machine | 950 W / program
microwave oven | 800 - 1200 W
TV | 70 - 180 W
refrigerator | 50 W
compact flurescent lamp | 11 - 22 W

**electrical energy**  
unit: kilowatt-hour (kW h) (this unit is more commonly used than joule (J))  
symbol: E   

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\E=Pt)  

**kilowatt-hour**  
def: 1 kW h is the energy transferred in 1 hour in an appiance whose power is 1 kilowatt  

1 kW h  
= 100 * 60 * 60  
= 3.6 * 10^6 J  
= 3.6 MJ
