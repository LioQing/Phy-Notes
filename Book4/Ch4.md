## Ch.4 Electromagnetism

## 4.1 Magnetic Forces and Magnetic Fields

**magnets**  
points north-south when freely hung  
south pole (S-pole) and north pole (N-pole)  

like poles repel; unlike poles attract

**magnetic fields (B-field)**  
def: the region where magnetic force exists  

**magnetic field lines**  
for represetation of magnetic fields  

properties:  
\- from N-pole round to S-pole  
\- shows direction of magnetic force  
\- closely spaced field lines represent stronger B-field, widely spaced represent weaker  
\- never cross each other  

**neutral point**  
def: point where no net magnetic field is present  

**earth's magnetic field**  
S-pole of the earth is in the north  
N-pole of the earth is in the south  

## 4.2 Magnetic Field of Electric Current  

**symbols for arrows perpendicular to paper**  
cross: into paper  
dot: out of paper  

**pattern around a long straigth wire**  
right-hand grip rule  
thumb = current direction  
other fingers = B-field  

properties:  
\- circles around the wire  
\- reversing current reverses direction of field lines  
\- stronger field closer to wire  

field strength calculation:
unit: tesla (T)

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\B=\frac{\mu_0I}{2{\pi}r})  

*μ<sub>0</sub>*: permeability of free space  
*I*: current through the wire  
*r*: distance from the wire

**pattern around a circular coil**  
right-hand grip rule  
thumb = B-field  
other fingers = current direction

**pattern due to a solenoid**  
rule same as above  

properties:  
\- field inside the solenoid is uniform  
\- field outside the solenoid is similar to a bar magnet  

strength can be increased by:  
\- increasing current  
\- increasing number of turns per length  
\- inserting a soft-iron core or steel core through  

remarks:  
\- soft-iron core switch off the field with the current  
\- steel core retains part of the field after current is switched off

field strength calculation:  
unit: tesla (T)  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\B=\frac{\mu_0NI}{l}=\mu_0nI)  

*N*: total number of turns in solenoid  
*l*: total length of solenoid  
*n*: number of turns per unit length (*N* / *l*)

**factors affecting strength of an electromagnet**  
\- number of turns per unit length of the coil (+ve relationship)  
\- current (+ve relationship)  
\- soft iron (increase strength)  

## 4.3 Force due to Mangetic Field

**Fleming's left-hand rule**

image from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleming%27s_left-hand_rule_for_motors  

thumb: magnetic force F  
index finger: magnetic field B
middle finger: current I  

**magnetic force on a current carrying wire**  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\F=BIlsin\theta)  

F: magnetic force  
B: magnetic field  
I: current  
l: length of wire inside the magnetic field  

**electric motor**  
makes use of turning effect on a coil to convert electrical energy to kindetic energy  

**simple d.c. motor**  

<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_xnxL2SWOPM/SGNYlyF6WCI/AAAAAAAAAI8/-9c-lzBNK9c/s320/DC-motor.png">  

mechanism of **commutator**:  
1\. changes contact from one brush to the other for every half cycle  
2\. this reverse the current through the coil  
3\. as a result, reversing the direction of the forces on the coil  
4\. the coil continues rotating in the same direction producing continous rotation  

## 4.4 Magnetic Forces on Moving Charge

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\F=BQv\sin\theta)  

Q: charge  
v: velocity  

**motion of a moving charge in a uniform magnetic field**  

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE\\\BQv=\frac{mv^2}{r}=mr\omega^2)  

m: mass  
r: radius of the circular motion  
ω: angular velocity
